# NLP Tutorial Python Project: Disaster Tweet Classification
This repository contains a tutorial on setting up the Python environment for an NLP project focused on a disaster tweet classification problem. The goal of the project is to classify tweets as either related to disasters or not based on their content. The dataset used in this project was scraped from a reliable source, ensuring its relevance and accuracy for training an NLP model.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (latest version)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, Visual Studio Code, or PyCharm
- Required Python libraries (listed below)

## Setting Up the Environment

### Step 1: Install Python
If you don't have Python installed, you can download and install the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). Make sure to add Python to your system's PATH during installation for easier command-line access.

### Step 2: Choose an IDE
For this project, we recommend using an IDE like Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, Visual Studio Code, or PyCharm. Install and configure your preferred IDE to work with Python.

### Step 3: Install Required Libraries
You'll need the following Python libraries to implement the NLP model. Install them using the following pip command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```

## Step 4: Prepare the Input Dataset
We will work with a dataset containing tweets labeled as disaster-related or non-disaster-related. Follow the instructions in the `data_preparation.py` file in this repository to download and prepare the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is essential before diving into model building. Here, we will explore the dataset to identify missing values, understand the frequency of different characters, words, and sentences, and explore the distribution of stopwords and punctuation marks.

### Steps for EDA:
- **Visualize Missing Values**: Use bar plots to examine the missing values in different columns of the dataset. Handle missing data by imputing with 'None' where necessary.
- **Analyze Textual Data**: Explore the frequency distribution of words and sentences, focusing on stopwords and punctuation marks, and remove them for better model performance.
- **Word Clouds**: Generate word clouds to visualize common terms used in the disaster-related and non-disaster-related tweets.

# Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a critical step in NLP to ensure meaningful linguistic analysis. The following steps are implemented in this project:

- **Handle Missing Data**: Replace missing values in the 'Keyword' column with 'None'.
- **Remove Irrelevant Elements**: Remove contractions, emojis, URLs, and specific punctuations.
- **Word Segmentation**: Break down the tweets into individual words (tokens).
- **Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base forms using lemmatization.

# Feature Extraction
Feature extraction is vital for enabling the NLP model to understand tweet content better. In this project, we create new features such as:

- **Polarity**: Sentiment score ranging from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive).
- **Subjectivity**: A score from 0 (factual) to 1 (opinionated).
- **Exclamation, Question Marks, URL, Hashtags, Mentions**: Count of specific tweet elements like exclamation marks, hashtags, etc.

These features are then added as new columns to the dataset.

# Word Embeddings
Word embeddings are dense numerical vectors that represent words in a multi-dimensional space. We use pretrained GloVe embeddings for this project.

- **Tokenization**: Split tweets into individual words and assign a unique number to each word.
- **Embedding Matrix**: Create an embedding matrix using the GloVe model to capture semantic relationships between words.

# Model Building
The final part of the tutorial involves building an NLP model to classify tweets as disaster-related or not. We explore two popular models in NLP:

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A type of recurrent neural network that is ideal for handling sequential data like text.
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: A transformer-based model pre-trained on massive amounts of text data.

## Model Building Steps:
- **N-gram Models**: Implement N-grams (bigrams and trigrams) to capture word patterns and relationships.
- **Train the Model**: Train the NLP model using the preprocessed and feature-rich dataset.
